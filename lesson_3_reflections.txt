When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1. To share my work with other team members
2. To backup my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you must have control of what changes you want to integrate in your local repository
