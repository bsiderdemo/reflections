When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1. To share my work with other team members
2. To backup my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you must have control of what changes you want to integrate in your local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks. clone a repository on github servers. 
clones. clone a repository from github server to local or local to local.
branches. create a commit labeled that represents a new path.

Use forks to get a copy of a repository on github but under your user name.
Use clone to create a local copy.
Use branch to experiment a new feature or maintain different versions of your code, e.g. different languages.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It makes possible to compare with remote version and resolve possible conflicts to merge.
